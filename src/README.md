Project Description: This is an application that will allow individuals to locate workspaces to work, create, and collaborate with other individuals.  

An individual will be presented with a list of these spaces and filter the list based upon entrance costs and available parking.

Initially, data was collected about the various workspaces in the area.  The workspaces were defined by 3 categories: workspaces, libraries, and coffee shops.
Other data such as workspace descriptions, capacities, available parking, fees, etc. 

The classes, interfaces, populator, controller, and application were built out and coded for the web application

We implemented the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern for designing this web application utilizing Thymeleaf templates.

Java was the scripting language used to code the application through the Spring Boot framework.

The Google Application Programming Interface (API) was used to plot the locations of the workspaces within Google Maps

The HTML code is was made responsive to be viewed in the viewport of varying dimensions.

Cascading Style Sheets, layout designs, and javascript language were implemented within the HTML code for greater expansion of capabilities, functionalities,
 and features
 
 Version control was manage through the creation, push, and pull of branches from the master file located on Git hub.
 
 Because Eclipse was use as the integrated development environment(IDE), Gradle was used to build out the web application allowing for the 
 insertion of various dependencies, such as, web, DevTools,JPA, as well as Thymeleaf--considering that it is the template engine used.
